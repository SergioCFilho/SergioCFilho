Here you'll find my works, scars, and stories of systems that should not have existed.

## 🧱 Hollow Projects

> — Possibly Me

| Project | Stack | Status | Summary |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| `legacy-crusade` | Laravel, JS | ☠️ Dead but remembered | Refactored a haunted CRM from 2013. Left with 3 sanity points. |
| `supabase-frenzy` | Supabase, Nuxt | 🔥 Ongoing | Building an MVP while Supabase occasionally screams. |
| `docker-summoner` | Docker, CI/CD | 🌀 Learning Arc | One container to rule them all (eventually). |
